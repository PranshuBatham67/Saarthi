This is the biggest project after learning flask for backend developement. In this project I have made multiple API like UserAuth&Autherization API, BloodBankAPI, and many more...

While making this project I learn many things like :
        1. What is redis? And, How to work with it?
        2. What is celey? And, How to work with it?
        3. How to use JWT authentication just like we use in node.js/express.js for this I use flask_jwt_extented library.
        4. How to document project?
        5. How to write the script to for testing endpoints of the API?
        6. What is the use of Enum??
