## ⚠️ Expected Authentication Failures (Working As Intended)

These endpoints correctly returned 401/403 errors when accessed without proper authentication:

- `GET /user/all` (without admin token) ⚠️ 401 - Authentication required
- `GET /admin/dashboard/stats` (without admin token) ⚠️ 403 - Admin access required

## 🔧 Issues Fixed During Testing

### 1. JWT Identity Parsing Issue ✅ RESOLVED
- **Problem:** Admin endpoints were failing with "Subject must be a string" error
- **Root Cause:** JWT identity was being stored as integer but expected as string
- **Solution:** Added `user_identity_loader` in Flask-JWT-Extended configuration
- **Files Modified:** `app/__init__.py`, `app/auth/decorators.py`

### 2. PowerShell JSON Syntax Issues ✅ RESOLVED  
- **Problem:** PowerShell was having issues parsing JSON strings with colons
- **Solution:** Used PowerShell hashtables converted to JSON for complex requests
