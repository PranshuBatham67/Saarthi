- PostgreSQL (recommended) or SQLite for development

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd hospital_management_system
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Flask Configuration
FLASK_APP=run.py
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-change-this-in-production
JWT_SECRET_KEY=jwt-secret-string-change-this-too

# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost/hospital_management
# For SQLite development: DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///hospital_management.db

# Admin Configuration
