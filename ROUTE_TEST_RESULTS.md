## Issues Identified & Status

### Minor Issues (2 failures out of 60 tests)
1. **Appointment Access Control** - ⚠️ Minor
   - **Issue**: User cannot access their own appointment details via `/appointment/opd/<id>`
   - **Status**: Access control may be too restrictive
   - **Impact**: Low - users can still see appointments via `/appointment/my-appointments`
   
2. **Appointment Cancellation** - ⚠️ Minor  
   - **Issue**: User cannot cancel appointment via `/appointment/opd/cancel/<id>`
   - **Status**: Related to same access control issue above
   - **Impact**: Low - affects user experience but system is functional

### Critical Issues
✅ **No Critical Issues Found** - All core functionality working

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix Appointment Access Control**: Review and adjust the access control logic for appointment endpoints to allow users to access their own appointments.

### Future Enhancements
1. **API Documentation**: Consider implementing Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
2. **API Versioning**: Implement versioning strategy for future API changes
3. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Add detailed performance monitoring
